We aim to recruit 10000 patients undergoing colonoscopy as part of BCSP or due to symptoms. Participants will be asked to fill in a health questionnaire and have their height, weight and waist circumference measured. They will also receive blood tests and stool tests, depending on the indication for their colonoscopy. The results of the colonoscopy and any samples taken will be collated. Patients will receive a patient experience questionnaire or food frequency questionnaire.
